## UI Design:

Aceternity UI and Shadcn UI: Ensure consistency in design elements and user experience across both interfaces. Use the strengths of each UI library to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
Tailwind CSS: Utilize Tailwind CSS to fine-tune styles and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
Backend:

Prisma DB Integration: Prisma simplifies database access and management. Ensure your models are well-defined and optimize database queries for performance.
Server Actions and API Integrations: Implement CRUD operations securely on the server-side, validating inputs and handling errors gracefully. Use RESTful APIs or GraphQL for efficient data transfer between the frontend and backend.
Frontend:

ReactQuery: Leverage ReactQuery for managing server state and caching data. Configure it to handle optimistic updates for a smoother user experience.
Authentication: Implement a secure authentication system using JWT tokens or session-based authentication. Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS or CSRF attacks.
